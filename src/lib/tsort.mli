      Partition a graph into its strongly-connected components:
      Two vertices u, v belong to the same component iff there's a path from
      u to v and there's a path from v to u.

      See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component

      The complexity is linear with respect to the input size.
      The current implementation uses the Kosarajuâ€“Sharir algorithm,
      which is described at
